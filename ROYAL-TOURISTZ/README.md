## Royal Touristz - Travel Website

I decided to make travel website because it has more scope to work around. It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential visitors and customers.


## User Experience (UX)

        2. I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are pink and purple (#f64c72 and #242582).
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Playfair Display font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Playfair Display is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.

    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. In the Hero section, I use video clip to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic. It will help me to promote my brand image and increase the trust of the customers.
